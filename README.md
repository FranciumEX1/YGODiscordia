# YGODiscordia
Something I'm trying out for Discord; using the Discordia API library ran in Luvit. It's pretty messy but eh, I'll try to clean it up soon. An attempt to create a Yu-Gi-Oh battle game through the Discord app to be played in my server.

Currently have over 400 cards across monsters, spells and traps. All the monsters currently in are Normal (non-effect) monsters.

Full list soon
